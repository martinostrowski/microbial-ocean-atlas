The Microbial Ocean Atlas project (2021-2022) received investment (https://doi.org/10.47486/XN004) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). 

This dataset has been made possible through collaboration with the Australian marine research community with sustained support for the Marine Microbes (2015-2018) and Australian Microbiome Initiatives (2018-2021) in partnership with Bioplatforms Australia and the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS). IMOS, Bioplatforms Australia and The ARDC are funded by the Australian National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). The [Australian Microbiome Initiative](https://www.australianmicrobiome.com) received additional support from Parks Australia through the Bush Blitz program funded by the Australian Government and BHP, and the CSIRO.

Marine samples collected and sequenced prior to 2015 were supported by the Australian Marine Microbial Biodiversity Initiative (AMMBI) with funding from Australian Research Council awards DP0988002 to Brown & Fuhrman, DP120102764 to Seymour, Brown & Bodrossy, DP150102326 to Brown, Ostrowski, Fuhrman & Bodrossy, the Environmental Genomics Project from CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere and a CSIRO OCE Science Leader Fellowship to Bodrossy. Sample collection and contextual data measurements for AMMBI was also supported by IMOS through NCRIS.

Research Voyages: Sample collection for the Marine Microbes and Australian Microbiome Initiatives was supported by the Australian Marine National Facility on voyages: SS2010_v09, SS2012_t07, SS2013_t03, IN2014_E03, IN2015_v04, IN2016_v03, IN2016_t01, IN2016_t02, IN2016_v04, IN2019_v03.
